# üèóÔ∏è Architecture ‚Äì Voice Note Classifier (Low-Cost AI Workflow)

This document describes the internal structure and logic of the n8n automation workflow for transcribing and classifying Telegram voice messages.

---

## üîÑ High-Level Flow

1. **Receive Voice Message**  
   Triggered by a Telegram bot when a new voice message is received.

2. **Download Audio**  
   The audio file is downloaded from Telegram using its `file_id`.

3. **Transcription (Whisper)**  
   The audio is transcribed using OpenAI Whisper (via the OpenAI API).

4. **AI Classification (Category + Concept)**  
   The transcribed text is analyzed to extract:
   - `Categoria`: keyword or tag (e.g., ‚Äúideas‚Äù, ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù)
   - `Concepto`: concise idea extracted from the content

5. **Validate Output Format**  
   The AI output is validated against a JSON schema to ensure it complies with the expected structure.

6. **Format for Storage**  
   Fields are mapped and prepared: transcription, category, concept, and unique file ID.

7. **Save to Google Sheets**  
   Appends a new row with the processed information.

8. **Export CSV + Save to Google Drive**  
   A CSV version of the data is generated and stored in a specified Drive folder.

9. **User Confirmation on Telegram**  
   A confirmation message is sent back to the user, summarizing that processing is complete.

10. **Error Handling**  
   If any step fails, an alert message is sent to an admin chat.

## üìä Google Sheets Structure

The spreadsheet must contain the following columns (in this exact order):

| Column Name     | Description                                    |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| file_unique_id  | Unique ID of the voice file from Telegram      |
| Categoria       | Category label extracted from the text         |
| Concepto        | Key idea or summarized concept                 |
| Transcripci√≥n   | Full text transcription of the message         |

**Example:**

| file_unique_id | Categoria | Concepto | Transcripci√≥n |
|----------------|----------|---------|---------------|
| AgJ6ABCdEfG12... | Ideas | Optimize logistics | "Category ideas. We need to reduce times..." |

## üìå Notes
---
- This architecture enables fast classification and data logging of ideas, thoughts, or meeting notes received via voice.
- Ensure all API credentials are set via environment variables.
- The workflow is optimized for low-cost usage by limiting token-heavy steps.
- Designed to be modular, easy to extend, and deployable on Railway or locally.
